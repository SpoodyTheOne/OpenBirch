loop over every character in string

check if the character is an operand

	if workingRegister is a number and the savedRegister is full
		set the current node to a node where

		set current node to the new node
		
	
	add current character to operandRegister
	
	if the operandRegister contains a keyword
		set current node operand
		clear operandRegister
		
check if the character is a number
	if it is, add
