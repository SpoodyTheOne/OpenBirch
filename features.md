# Features which would be cool to have
## Main features

* Evaluate math expressions
* declare variables and functions for usage later in worksheet
* Multiple tabs with different worksheets
* Save and load to file
* Create LaTeX/MathML expressions and evaluate them
* 2D and 3D Plot functions
* Integrate and differentiate functions
* Show intermediate steps for evaluating expressions
* Triangle calculator (like in wordmat)
* Write text and insert images to worksheets

### Plot features
* Plot 3d graph of the volume of revolution of functions
* Taylor series approximation of functions

## Maybe features
### big data
* spreadsheets
* Compatability with copying data from LibreOffice calc table's etc.
* plot data (scatter plot etc.)
* regression of data (linear regression, polynomial regression etc.)

### Cool things, but will probably not be implemented
* Compatability with maple .mw files
